# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Titanic Survival Dataset**, originally from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The analysis aims to uncover key factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic 1912 sinking of the Titanic.

## 📁 Dataset Files

- `train.csv` – Main dataset used for analysis and visualization.
- `test.csv` – Reserved for potential predictive modeling (not used in current EDA).
- `gender_submission.csv` – Sample submission file (not used in current EDA).

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset.
- Analyze passenger data using descriptive statistics.
- Visualize survival trends by class, gender, and age.
- Draw meaningful conclusions based on the patterns discovered.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Passenger Class:** Passengers in first class had a higher survival rate. Most passengers (55%) were in third class, which had the lowest survival rate.
- **Gender:** Females were significantly more likely to survive than males.
- **Age:** Younger passengers and children had higher survival rates compared to older adults.
